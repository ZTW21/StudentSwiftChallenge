# Student Swift Challenge App

This app, developed as part of the Student Swift Challenge, allows users to select images from their device and then uses a Median Cut Quantization (MMCQ) algorithm to determine the dominant colors in those images. The dominant colors are then displayed to the user as a palette. 

## Features

- **Image Selection:** Users can select images from their device to analyze.
- **Dominant Color Extraction:** The app uses the MMCQ algorithm to extract dominant colors from the selected images.
- **Color Palette Display:** Displays a palette of dominant colors extracted from the image.
- **Color Copy Feature:** Users can tap on a color in the palette to copy its hexadecimal value to the clipboard.
- **User Interface:** The app features an intuitive and user-friendly interface built using SwiftUI.
